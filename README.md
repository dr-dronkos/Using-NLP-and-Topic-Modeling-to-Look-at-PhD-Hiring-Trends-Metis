# The PhD Candidate: Using NLP and Topic Modeling to Look at PhD Hiring Trends

## Abstract
Since 2020, an increasing number of people with PhDs -- both new graduates and tenured professors -- have been choosing to leave academia and pivot into industry. While Academic Twitter is full of useful anecdotes from PhDs who have successfully pivoted and advice from career counselors targeting former academics, there is a lack of comprehensive data on employers: Which companies, if any, are explicitly targeting PhDs as potential hires? What kind of skills are they looking for in thier ideal candidates? This project attempted to answer some of these questions using NLP and a corpus of ~ 5,200 job descriptions scraped from Tapwage.com using BeautifulSoup and tokenized using spaCy. After trying several combinations of document vectorizers and topic modeling algorithms, the best performing combination modeled the lemmas of nouns and proper nouns (as assigned by spaCy) into 18 semantically coherent topics. I then used these topics as features in a weighted Logistic Regression model to successfully predict whether a job description was for an Academic job or an Industry job, achieving 91 percent accuracy. I also plotted the top 2,000 words from the corpus in an interactive ScatterText vizualization, which is linked in the Communication section below.
